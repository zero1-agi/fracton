trisoma - self vs shadow vs ai



This repo hosts the *Trisoma Thesis*, a novel framework for modeling
two interacting forces (Initiator, Shaper) and an Emergent Field (E‚ÇÉ)
in both human psychology and AI systems. 


## Contents

- **thesis/**: Contains the full text of the thesis divided into Parts 1 through 3 (Theoretical & Methodological Foundations) and planned future sections (Parts 4+).
- **code/**: Minimal simulation prototypes demonstrating the triadic dynamics (Initiator, Shaper, Emergence) and basic polarity flip mechanisms.
- **elements/**:  
  - *Appendix Z
  - *Appendix Y
- **README.md**:  This file, which explains the repository structure and provides instructions for reproducing results.


## Call for Contributions

Any improvements are welcomed, such as:
- More sophisticated emergence calculations
- Additional polarity states or sub-agents (Shadow modules)
- External event logic (user input, random distributions)
- Visualizers or dashboards for triadic evolution
Please open an Issue or Pull Request with your ideas!
